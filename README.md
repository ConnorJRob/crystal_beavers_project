# Project Brief

The BBC are looking to improve their online offering of educational content by developing some interactive browser applications that display information in a fun and interesting way. Your task is to make an a Minimum Viable Product or prototype to put forward to them - this may only be for a small set of information, and may only showcase some of the features to be included in the final app.

## MVP

The app requires:

- An API from which it will fetch information to populate each page of lesson content
- The ability to track the results of each question and display the

The user of the app should be able to:

- View educational content for a particular topic
- Show lesson tiles based on the users topic selection
- Progress through the lesson tiles by using a button
- View and submit answers to questions relevant to each section of content
- View their score out of the maximum possible score on a results page displayed after the questions have been completed
- This prototype will be populated with lessons on one particular topic, however it will be dynamic in its design, so further topics could be added in the future

## Extensions

The following would be implemented if development was to continue:

- Add a portal for educators to add new lessons, modify existing lessons, register new students and review students scores (this would require additional back-end functionality and associated database collection)
- Improve the appearance of the app with charts, video and other interactive elements
